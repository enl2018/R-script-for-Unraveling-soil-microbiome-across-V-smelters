# including:
# RF_0130, random forest analysis using "RandomForest" function to support the creation of sample groups by screening the important driving factors for community structure based on percentage increases in the MSE (mean squared error).
# VPA1, variable partitioning analysis using "Vegan" package to quantify the relative contribution of explanatory variables on community variation.
# Mantel7, Mantel's test using "Vegan" package to associate influence variables with community structure and disentangle the interactive patterns between individual determinants.
# NCM_0111, using R package “Hmisc, stat4 and minpack.lm” to predict the relationship between OTU detection frequency and their relative abundance.
# bNTI_Rscript_0116, using “picante” to calculate the standardized effect size measure of the mean nearest taxon distance (SES.MNTD) and β mean nearest taxon distance (βMNTD).
# Beta_RC, using “raup_crick.dist” function to partitioning the relative influence of stochastic process (dispersal limitation, undominated, homogeneous dispersal).
